# TO DO LIST
### Bug Squashing
This is simple to do list, however it has some bugs. Your job is to find and address these bugs. It is safe to assume that all existing tests are correct. Please use the tests to resolve the bugs before moving onto the next step.

### Implement a Feature
Once the bugs are resolved you can implement any of the features listed below. Please keep in mind this is intended to only take an hour to an hour and a half. Don't worry about completing everything if you run out of time.

*Feature Options:*
- add a breadcrumb to the UI
- add or extend an existing controller action to requests for a `task_list` and all its `tasks`
  - JSON response
- add system tests to the test suite

### Setup App
This app is using `rails 7.0.1` and `ruby 3.0.0`. Once you have them both installed on your machine you can create, migrate and seed your database using `rails db:setup`.

After this you should be good to go.
